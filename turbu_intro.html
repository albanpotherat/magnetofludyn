<h2>Anisotropic turbulence</h2>
<p>
Turbulence is a fascinating physical phenomenon which enables flows to dissipate
 very large amounts of kinetic energy. In laminar flows, energy can only be
dissipated by viscous friction, which occurs in small and rather localised
regions where strong velocity gradients exist, for instance near the walls of a
pipe. In intense flows, these regions do not produce enough dissipation, yet,
viscous friction is still the only mechanism available. Nature's answer to this paradox is to reorganise the flow in such a way that strong velocity gradients
invade the bulk of the flow. Such gradients are created by intense flow
fluctuations, over a spectrum of lengthscales ranging from that of the flow
domain to very small ones where viscous dissipation is most efficient. One of
the most remarkable features of turbulence is to operate in a radically
different way in 2D and <a href=q2d_intro.php>quasi-2D flows</a> than it does
in 3D flows. 3D turbulence is characterised by a direct energy cascade:
inertial effects break down large vortices into smaller ones, and repeat the
process until the energy is transfered to the dissipative scales where viscous
dissipation acts. In 2D turbulence, on the contrary, vortices agglomerate into
larger ones under the effect of 2D inertia, thus transferring their energy to
the larger scales. These in turn exert considerable friction on the flow
boundaries where dissipation is enhanced.
</p>
<p>
If the fluid is electrically conducting, applying a magnetic field to it has
two effects: firstly, it elongates the vortices along the field direction, thus
introducing a strong anisotropy. Secondly, the electric currents created in the
process dissipate energy by Joule heating. MagnetoHydroDynamic (MHD) turbulence
therefore introduces a competition between two dissipation mechanisms, but most
remarkably, it can be either 3D or quasi-2D, if the vortices are elongated up
to boundaries of the fluid domain. We explore these phenomena both with theory
and experiment: We have built a modular rig where vortices and turbulence are
generated in liquid metals, and diagnosed by measuring electric potentials
in a large number of points in and around the flow, as well as by ultra-sound
velocimetry.
We are also developing a new type of spectral method that takes advantage of
the mathematical properties of the governing equations to perform more
efficient numerical simulations of MHD turbulence.
